# Big Business (Review Guide 248 - 259)

## Overview
The last quarter of 19th century was referred to the Age of Invention because of the various technological advances (most notably light bulb and use of electricity). These advances, in turn, generated greater opportunities for mass production and led the economy to grow tremendously.

## Industrialization, Corporate Consolidation, and the Gospel of Wealth
- Businessmen realized that they needed to maximize efficiency in order to lower the cost of productions. Thus, workers were expected to perform like machines for 12-14 hours a day (in assembly line). Factories were dangerous.
- Big corporations sought to consolidate itself by means of horizontal/vertical integration.
	* Horizontal integration: buy/merge with competitors.
	* Vertical integration: buy other part of the business in order to reduce cost of production.
	* Example: Let A be an oil company. If A buys another oil company B to increase its market share/reduce competitors, it uses horizontal integration. If A buys a railroad company to make its transportation cheaper, it performs vertical integration.
- Big businesses led to two problems:
	1. As businessmen borrowed huge sums, bank failures could result from their occasional failures (multiple economic panic in late 19th Century).
	2. Led to inequality and public resentment.
- Anti-trust policies:
	* Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was enacted due to public pressure.
	* However, the supreme court was pro-business and interpret the law as it saw fit (E.C. Knight v. US).
	* Labor Union on the other hand was often found to be "in restraint of free trade".
	* Clayton Antitrust Act finally addressed the issue.

## Factories and City Life
- Manufactures sought to reduce production cost in every way, including hiring women and children. They also hired many newly arrived immigrants who were anxious to get a job.
- Living conditions of the workers were very bad. They often lived in poor neighborhoods in the cities. Middle class moved away from city center thanks to mass transportation.
- "Political bosses" provided service for the poor, in exchange for votes. Notable example was William "Boss" Tweed.
- Labor Union were formed to deal with the widespread misery.
	* Knights of Labor was one of the first union formed.
	* They demanded the following:
		1. Eight-hour work day
		2. Equal pay for men and women
		3. Child labor laws
		4. Safety and sanitary codes
	* Many were associated with violence in the public eye (Haymarket Square Riot, Homestead Steel factory strike).
	* Early Unions often appealed to socialist ideals.
- Charitable middles-class organizations, usually run by women, provided settlement houses in poor neighborhoods. Most notable example was Jane Addams in Chicago.

- Jim Crow law brought segregation
- In Plessy v. Ferguson, the supreme court ruled "separate but equal", effectively setting back civil rights gained in the reconstruction.
