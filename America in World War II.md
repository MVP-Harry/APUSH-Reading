# American in World War II

## War Time
- Outraged by Japanese's attack on Pearl Harbor, US declared war on the Axis Power
	* Patriotism was high
	* Japanese Americans faced discrimination and espionage, and were forced to move to concentration camps under **Executive Order No. 9066**.

- Massive military orders immediately soaked up America's Depression economy
	* Orchestrated by the **War Production Board** (WPB)
	* Halted manufacture of nonessential items and committed the entire American industry into war preparation
	* **Smith-Connally Anti-Strike Act** made strikes against any government-operated industry a criminal offense, in fear of labor union disrupting war production

- 15 million men were drafted into war, leaving many job opportunities behind, which around 6 million women took over. Note that, however, the role of women did not change right after the war; instead, women went back to more "traditional" roles.

- WWII and its postwar consequences radically shifted the roles of African Americans
	* The war saw the first step towards desegregation in war industry as Roosevelt established the **Fair Employment Practices Commission**
	* Members of **Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)** shot up to half-million
	* Around 1.7 million Blacks migrated from the South to other areas of US

- WWII, however, was extremely beneficial to US economy as it single-handedly cured the depression economy. While most countries were still recovering from the war, US economy prospered.

## Military
- Battle of Midway saw US defeating Japan and sinking four Japanese carriers. Led my Admiral Nimitz, Battle of Midway was a pivoting moment of the Pacific war front.

- General MacArthur defended New Guinea successfully, which was the last buffer protecting Australia. He had fought his way westward through tropical jungle hells and completed the first leg of his return journey to the Philippines.

- Leapfrogging was the strategy of attacking Japanese-held islands to serve as military bases, and it was widely adopted by the American Navy.

- The allies also made substantial progress in defending and push back the Nazis
	* In the Atlantic ocean, the British held off German submarines and gradually regained control of the sky
	* In North Africa, General Montgomery defeated the "Desert Fox" Rommel
	* The Soviets stalled German troops at Stalingrad and many German division later surrendered in the winter
