Reading: Review Guide 235 - 241

## Overview
Three major questions: 
1. Under what conditions will the Southern states be readmitted?
2. Status of Black people?
3. What would be done to the rebels?

## Reconstruction and Johnson's Impeachment
- Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan vs Radical Republicans' Wade-David Bill
	* The republicans were divided among conservatives, moderates, and radicals
		- Conservatives (Ex: Lincoln, Johnson) desired national unity, didn't want to punish the South too hard
		- Radicals wanted revenge to the South
	* Neither plan were approved
- Johnson's Reconstruction Plan
	* Johnson became the president after Lincoln's assassination
	* Required southern citizens to sear a loyalty oath
	* Barred many elites from participating in politics
- Failure of Johnson's Plan
	* Johnson pardoned too many elites. The slave holders remained powerful
	* Southerns passed Black codes, limiting Freedman's freedom
- Fourteenth Amendment
	* Part of Radical Republicans' plan
	1. If you are born in the US, you are a citizen
	2. Prohibited states from depriving rights of a citizen
	3. Prevented states from denying equal rights for any citizen
	4. Gave states the choice either to give freedman the right to vote or decrease power in the Congress
	5. Barred prominent Confederates from holding office
	6. Excused the Confederacy's war debt
- Johnson campaigned against the Fourteenth Amendment and failed
- Military Reconstruction of 1867: imposed martial law on the South; required each state to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment
- Impeachment against Johnson when the conflict between Congress and Johnson became more intense
- Fifteenth Amendment: required states to enfranchise Black men
		
## The Failure of Reconstruction
- Corruption in the Grant's government
	* Gilded Age
	* Grant was not part of the corruption, although many of his friends were
	* Tainted the Reconstruction
- Ku Klux Klan
	* Terrorist group
	* Focused on murdering freedmen and republicans
	* A pain in the ass in the South
- Supreme Court consistently restricted the scope of the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth amendment
- Redeemers: Southern Democrats that opposed the reconstruction
- Compromise of 1877
	* Marked the ending of the Military reconstruction of 1867
	* For many years, life of Black people become worse

## Southern Blacks During and After the Reconstruction
- Blacks were thrust into an ambiguous state of freedom
- Sharecropping: the system where Black people traded a portion of their crop in return for the right to work at someone else's lands
- Mississippi became progressive with its massive black population
