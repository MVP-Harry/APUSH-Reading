Context: In the early 20th century, United States is no longer a weak nation that can be easily manipulated by European powers. Thanks to its strong economy and navy, United States has become an influential force. As World War I broke out between the Allies and the Central Powers, US faced a tough question: whether to stay neutral or join the war. On one hand, US was used to isolationism in the 19th century and simply staying out of the way from global affairs seemed like an good option. On the other hand, US had much more connection with England than countries in the Central Powers.

Thesis: Before entering the war in 1917, although US managed to stay neutral on the surface, it clearly favored the Allies.
