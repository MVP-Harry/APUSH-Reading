= Week 5 Reading =

== Textbook (Chapter 8) ==
* Overview: American Revolution was not  a radical or total change, rather it was an accelerated evolution.

=== 8-1 A Shaky Start Toward Union ===
* The new government had a rough start
	- Confusion among the thirteen states
	- Competition caused by British manufacturers; industry suffered from such ruthless competition
* Hopeful signs
	- Rich political inheritance
	- Promising leaders such as Washington, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson

=== 8-2 Constitution Making in the States ===
* New Constitutions 
	- The Continental Congress in 1776 called upon the colonies to draft new constitutions
	- Among all, Massachusetts brought some innovations
		a) A special convention was called to draft constitutions; the final draft was then ratified by the people
		b) Once adopted, the constitution could only be changed when another convention was called
		c) This procedure was later adopted to the making of the federal constitution
* Constitution
	- A written document (unlike British constitution, which is an accumulation of traditions)
	- Fundamental Law, superior to the ordinary legislatures 

=== Economic Crosscurrents ===
* Independence had drawbacks on the economy
	- Trades with Britain were banned
	- Fisheries & bounties for ships' stores were disrupted
	- Some states borrowed a lot of money during the war; caused inflation
	- Average citizens suffered financially 
* Benefits of Independence on the economy
	- Free trade compensated for the loss of old ones
	- Trade in Baltic & China Seas

=== Creating a Confederation ===
* The Second Continental Congress was not constitutionally authorized
* Article of Confederation
	- A drafted constitution of the new nation
	- Needed the unanimous approval from the thirteen states
	- Land-hungry states such as Maryland wanted lands from New York and did not agree to the Article of Confederation until 1781

=== The Articles of Confederation: America's First Constitution ===
* The Articles of Confederation provided a loose confederation or "firm league of friendship" 
* Congress was weak
	- Designed to be weak, as the states didn't want to lose control over taxation and commerce to the congress
	- Tax-collection system of congress was not effective
	- Could not command or coerce states
* Nevertheless, it was a landmark in government and a significant stepping stone to present day congress.

=== Landmarks in Land Laws ===

	- Spain was also unfriendly to America (especially over territories and lands) 

=== The Horrid Specter of Anarchy ===
* Economic storm continued to cause a negative impact in the 1780s
* Individual states were getting out of hand
	- Quarrels over boundaries generated some minor battles
* Shays' Rebellion in Massachusetts
	- Led by Daniel Shays, a veteran of the revolutionary war
	- Demanded the state to lighten taxes etc.
	- An alarm to the system
* A stronger central government was needed
	- Amendment of the existing constitution would take a very long time
	- Adopt a completely new constitution?

=== A Convention of "Demigods" ===
* As the problems over commerce and between individual states worsened, congress issued a convention.
* Representatives of the convention 
	- Elected by the states
	- Respected & Educated
	- Participants were called "demigods" (people with very high caliber)
	- George Washington was unanimously elected as the chairman
	- Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton were all present 
	- Thomas Jefferson, John Adams etc. were absent

=== Patriots in Philadelphia ===
* The delegates were all elitists
* They hoped to crystallize the Revolutionary Idealism into a stable political structure
* Believed in Republicanism but pushed for a stronger central government
* Sought to curb the unrestrained democracy (largely due to the rebellion led by Shays)
